# Define an NVMf Subsystem.
# - NQN is required and must be unique.
# - Mode may be either "Direct" or "Virtual". Direct means that physical
#   devices attached to the target will be presented to hosts as if they
#   were directly attached to the host. No software emulation or command
#   validation is performed. Virtual means that an NVMe controller is
#   emulated in software and the namespaces it contains map to block devices
#   on the target system. These block devices do not need to be NVMe devices.
#   Only Direct mode is currently supported.
# - Between 0 and 255 Host directives are allowed. This defines the
#   NQNs of allowed hosts. If no Host directive is specified, all hosts
#   are allowed to connect if AllowAnyHost is true.
# - AllowAnyHost may be either true or false. If it is set, any host can
#   access the subsytem even though no Host is specifiec.
#   . AllowAnyHost does not affect the Discovery Controller
#   . When AllowAnyHost is missing, the global AllowAnyHost setting
#     is used for the Subsytem.
#   . When AllowAnyHost is false a valid Host NQN must be added to
#     the Subsystem. Valid NQNs must contain no upper case letters.
#   Optionally, max_io_queue_depth and max_queue_num parameter can be
#   defined on the Host directive line. The format of the Host 
#   directive line is:  
#
#           Host <nqn> [max_io_queue_depth] [max_queue_num]
#
#   Note: Valid host NQNs can be generated with the Linux 
#   'nvme get-hostnqn' utility. To make the The Linux host
#   NQN persistent, add to the /etc/nvme/hostnqn file.
#
#   E.g.:
#
#   $ sudo nvme gen-hostnqn | tr A-Z a-z > /etc/nvme/hostnqn
#   $ cat /etc/nvme/hostnqn
