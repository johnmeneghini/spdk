# Define an NVMf Subsystem.
# - NQN is required and must be unique.
# - Core may be set or not. If set, the specified subsystem will run on
#   it, otherwise each subsystem will use a round-robin method to allocate
#   core from available cores,  lcores are numbered starting at 0.
# - Mode may be either "Direct" or "Virtual". Direct means that physical
#   devices attached to the target will be presented to hosts as if they
#   were directly attached to the host. No software emulation or command
#   validation is performed. Virtual means that an NVMe controller is
#   emulated in software and the namespaces it contains map to block devices
#   on the target system. These block devices do not need to be NVMe devices.
#   Only Direct mode is currently supported.
# - Between 1 and 255 Listen directives are allowed. This defines
#   the addresses on which new connections may be accepted. The format
#   is Listen <type> <address> where type currently can only be RDMA.
# - Between 0 and 255 Host directives are allowed. This defines the
#   NQNs of allowed hosts. If no Host directive is specified, all hosts
#   are allowed to connect. Optionally, a max_io_queue_depth and max_queue_num
#   parameter can be defined on the Host directive line. The format of the
#   Host directive line is:  Host <nqn> [max_io_queue_depth] [max_queue_num]
# - Exactly 1 NVMe directive specifying an NVMe device by PCI BDF. The
#   PCI domain:bus:device.function can be replaced by "*" to indicate
#   any PCI device.
# - AllowAnyHost may be either true or false. If it is set, any host can
#   access the subsytem even thougth it is not added to it.
#   . AllowAnyHost does not affect the Discovery Controller
#   . When AllowAnyHost is missing, the global AllowAnyHost setting
#     is used for the Subsytem.
#   . When AllowAnyHost is false a valid Host NQN must be added to
#     the Subsystem. Valid NQNs must contain no upper case letters.
# - AllowAnyListener may be either true or false. If it is set, any listener can
#   access the subsytem even thougth it is not added to it.
#   . When AllowAnyListener is missing, the global AllowAnyListener setting
#     is used for the Subsytem.
#   . When AllowAnyListener is false a valid Listener address must be added to
#     the Subsystem.
#
# Note: Valid host NQNs can be generated with the Linux 'nvme get-hostnqn' utility.
#      To make the The Linux host NQN persistent, add to the /etc/nvme/hostnqn file.
#
#  E.g.:
#
#  $ sudo nvme gen-hostnqn | tr A-Z a-z > /etc/nvme/hostnqn
#  $ cat /etc/nvme/hostnqn
